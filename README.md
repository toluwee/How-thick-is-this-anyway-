# How thick is it anyway?
### Predict key property using ensemble machine learning

## Objective
* Predict the apparent viscosity of nanoparticle stabilized CO2 foam for hydraulic fracturing using supervised machine learning techniques.
* Blending, a variant of stacking ensemble learning technique explored as alternative for expensive laboratory experiments.
* Determine the influence of various parameters on apparent viscosity prediction.

## The Dataset
329 input data points were compiled from the published results of Xiao et al. (2017), Fu and Liu (2020) and Fu and Liu (2021) laboratory rheology experiments on stabilized CO2-foam at high temperatures and pressure for hydraulic fracturing. 
The dataset we obtained contained 329 data records, comprising 224, 60, 45 data from the studies by Xiao et al. (2017), Fu and Liu (2020), and Fu and Liu (2021), respectively. 

## Key Skills Demonstrated
* Ensemble learning technique
* Significant feature identification using PCA and Permutation Feature importance
* Model tuning and evaluation
* Model comparison
